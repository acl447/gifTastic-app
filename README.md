Technologies used to make this app are the GIPHY API, HTML5, JavaScript, JQuery, CSS and Bootstrap.


Link to deployed project on GitHub Pages: https://acl447.github.io/gifTastic-app/gifTastic.html


To make this app, I generated the buttons dynamically using JavaScript and JQuery. Also using JavaScript and JQuery, I created a function that grabs the value of what the user has entered into the textbox and dynamically generates a new button. 

I also wrote a function that makes an AJAX call to the GIPHY API and returns 10 gifs every time a gif button is clicked. Lastly, I wrote a function that causes each gif to animate when clicked and to return to a still image when clicked again.
